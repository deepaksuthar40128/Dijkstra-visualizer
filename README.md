# Dijkstra Algorithm Visualizer for Matrix Pathfinding

[Dijkstra Algorithm Visualizer](https://dijkstra-visualizer-theta.vercel.app/)

This project is a visualization tool that demonstrates the Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a matrix from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The matrix is filled with numbers in a given range, and movement is allowed in all four directions (up, down, left, and right). The visualization is built using Node.js and utilizes worker threads to ensure that the main thread remains unblocked during the Dijkstra's algorithm calculations.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm for matrix pathfinding.
- Efficient use of worker threads to prevent the main thread from blocking during calculations.
- Randomly generates a matrix filled with numbers in the specified range.
- Animates the process of finding the shortest path step by step.
- Highlights visited nodes, current node under consideration, and the final shortest path.
- Easy-to-understand UI to control the visualization speed,range of numbers and colors of visualization.
- You can also check the logical cpus of the system [here](https://dijkstra-visualizer-theta.vercel.app/cpus).
